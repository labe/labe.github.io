<p><em>Two languages, both alike in dignity<br>
In fair Chicago, where we lay our scene...</em></p>

<p>Toward the end of April 2013, I began my journey into web development as a student in the first-ever cohort of Dev Bootcamp Chicago. Nine weeks and 1000 hours of recursion and algorithms and git and SQL and ActiveRecord and Sinatra and OOJS/jQuery/AJAX and HTML/CSS and Ruby on Rails projects later, I graduated with a proficient enough skillset that qualified me to interview for junior dev positions across the board-- and instead got to indulge a lifelong delight in teaching by accepting an offer from Dev Bootcamp to join staff as a junior instructor.</p>

<p>Thus it was that six weeks later, I had a fortuitous encounter with one of DBC's fantastic mentors, <a href="https://github.com/ltw" class="user-mention">@ltw</a>, that started on Twitter...</p>

<p><img src="http://i.minus.com/ijkMFRw6yNVIO.png" alt="Twitter: sparking neo-revolutions since yesterday"></p>

<p>...and culminated in his encouraging me, while he was hanging out at DBC, to watch Bret Victor's presentation on <a href="http://worrydream.com/dbx">"The Future of Programming"</a>. The video session then segued into a conversation about logic programming, which led to an introduction to Prolog, which concluded with a passing mention of the <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle">Einstein/Zebra Problem</a>.</p>

<p>The following day, on my lunch break, I attempted said problem and got to the solution using a Google Docs spreadsheet, and whatever hooks Prolog had sunk into me the day before only dug in deeper after my hour spent buried in pure logical deduction.</p>

<p>I have since resolved to learn as much as I can about Prolog. There's a fair amount of <a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable/doc/SWI-Prolog-6.4.1.pdf">documentation</a> at the moment, including a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">nice Wikipedia page</a> and this <a href="http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php">pretty neat tutorial</a>, but it's all written in a classical (read: dry) style that makes it hard to stay engaged. My greater aim is to learn as much as I can about Prolog so I can encourage others in this modern era of programming-language-learning to see the value and beauty (and practical application) of Prolog's essence.</p>

<p>Vintage is cool again. I was late to the game on the lindy revival (swing music and dancing from the 1920s and '30s saw a resurgence in popularity in the '90s-- see: Gap commericals, Squirrel Nut Zippers) but with Clojure's popularity ramping up and spawning things like core.logic, something tells me Prolog's opportunity to re-emerge into the programming world's limelight is on the horizon.</p>

<p>In first undergrad, I studied Sanskrit and Gaelic for funsies. True story, bro.</p>

<p>Also in first undergrad, I minored in philosophy, and my two favorite classes were Intro to Logic (Honors) and Philosophy of Knowledge (both of which happened to be taught by the department chair, whom I absolutely adored to no end). I can go down rabbit holes of how-does-one-define-truth for hours and weeks on end. I will openly confess that some part of me hopes that by learning how to define the fundamental elements of truthiness in Prolog, I will simultaneously learn how to do the same in the world overall.</p>

<p>This project is a collection of stream-of-consciousness-esque notes documenting a burgeoning relationship between a 17-weeks-trained logic-and-language-loving programmer and a 41-year-old lovable logic programming language.</p>
