#Setting up a sandbox in OS X
##Or: Establishing the Environment


###Questions Explored!

####How do I install this language (which was created in like 1970 OMG) onto my machine (which was created in 2013 (namely: an 11'' Macbook <strike>Amateur</strike> Air))?

go to the website
download a thing
say yes!

####Okay it's installed. How do I play around with it? What's the Prolog version of irb?

run the shell command
possibly alias <code>swipl</code>
create a sample program
load a sample program
write driver code
show "next_to" program

###Questions Raised But Left Yet Mostly Unexplored!

* Can I execute a Prolog program the same way I execute a Ruby program? (e.g., Ruby programs with driver code tests can output to the screen)
* What the hell am I doing. What is the terminology? What have I gotten myself into??
