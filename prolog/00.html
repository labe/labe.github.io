<h1>Setting up a sandbox in OS X</h1>

<h2>Or: Establishing the Environment</h2>

<h3>Questions Explored!</h3>

<h4>How do I install this language (which was created in like 1970 OMG) onto my machine (which was created in 2013 (namely: an 11'' Macbook <strike>Amateur</strike> Air))?</h4>

<p>go to the website
download a thing
say yes!</p>

<h4>Okay it's installed. How do I play around with it? What's the Prolog version of irb?</h4>

<p>run the shell command
possibly alias <code>swipl</code>
create a sample program
load a sample program
write driver code
show "next_to" program</p>

<h3>Questions Raised But Left Yet Mostly Unexplored!</h3>

<ul>
<li>Can I execute a Prolog program the same way I execute a Ruby program? (e.g., Ruby programs with driver code tests can output to the screen)</li>
<li>What the hell am I doing. What is the terminology? What have I gotten myself into??</li>
</ul>
