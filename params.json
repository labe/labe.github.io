{"name":"A Prolog Prologue","tagline":"","body":"![Ruby-o and Jewel-iet](http://i.minus.com/idchwaJJgWvmv.png)\r\n\r\n*Two languages, both alike in dignity  \r\nIn fair Chicago, where we lay our scene...*\r\n\r\nToward the end of April 2013, I began my journey into web development as a student in the first-ever cohort of Dev Bootcamp Chicago. Nine weeks and 1000 hours of recursion and algorithms and git and SQL and ActiveRecord and Sinatra and OOJS/jQuery/AJAX and HTML/CSS and Ruby on Rails projects later, I graduated with a proficient enough skillset that qualified me to interview for junior dev positions across the board-- and instead got to indulge a lifelong delight in teaching by accepting an offer from Dev Bootcamp to join staff as a junior instructor.\r\n\r\nThus it was that in my 17th week at Dev Bootcamp, I had a fortuitous encounter with one of DBC's fantastic mentors, @ltw, that started on Twitter...\r\n\r\n![Twitter: sparking neo-revolutions since yesterday](http://i.minus.com/ijkMFRw6yNVIO.png)\r\n\r\n...and culminated in his encouraging me, while he was hanging out at DBC, to watch Bret Victor's presentation on [\"The Future of Programming\"](http://worrydream.com/dbx). The video session then segued into a conversation about logic programming, which led to an introduction to Prolog, which concluded with a passing mention of the Einstein/Zebra Problem.\r\n\r\nThe following day, on my lunch break, I attempted said problem and got to the solution using a Google Docs spreadsheet, and whatever hooks Prolog had sunk into me the day before only dug in deeper after my hour spent buried in pure logical deduction.\r\n\r\nI have since resolved to learn as much as I can about Prolog. There's a fair amount of documentation on the moment, including a nice Wikipedia page and this pretty neat tutorial, but it's all written in a classical (read: dry) style that makes it hard to stay engaged. My greater aim is to learn as much as I can about Prolog so I can produce new material to help others in this modern era of programming-language-learning see the value and beauty (and practical application) of Prolog's essence.\r\n\r\n##But why Prolog? It's 40 years old. It's practically FORTRAN! HAHAHA FORTRAN.\r\n\r\n###Age ain't nothing but a number.\r\nVintage is cool again. I was late to the game on the lindy revival (swing music and dancing from the 1920s and '30s saw a resurgence in popularity in the '90s-- see: Gap commericals, Squirrel Nut Zippers) but with Clojure's popularity ramping up and spawning things like core.logic, something tells me Prolog's opportunity to re-emerge into the programming world's limelight is on the horizon.\r\n\r\n###I am wild about ((practically)dead) languages.\r\nIn first undergrad, I studied Sanskrit and Gaelic for funsies. True story.\r\n\r\n###Epistemology fascinates me\r\nAlso in first undergrad, I minored in philosophy, and my two favorite classes were Intro to Logic (Honors) and Philosophy of Knowledge (both of which happened to be taught by the department chair, whom I absolutely adored to no end). I can go down rabbit holes of how-does-one-define-truth for hours and weeks on end. I will openly confess that some part of me hopes that by learning how to define the fundamental elements of truthiness in Prolog, I will simultaneously learn how to do the same in the world overall.\r\n\r\n##TL;DR\r\n\r\nThis is a collection of notes documenting a burgeoning relationship between a 17-week-old programming red panda enthusiast and a 40-year-old obscure programming language.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
